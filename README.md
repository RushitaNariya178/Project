Video Games Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

   Most of the video gaming business organizations highly depends on a knowledge base and demand prediction of sales trend. Such data can be used by game creators to extract knowledge for enhancing games. The aim of the study commits to analyze the concept of gaming sales data and sales prediction. This approach is useful to several industries which are interested in predicting the sales data. The existing framework deals with various machine learning techniques on the basis of performance evaluation like linear regression, support vector regression, random forest and decision trees that are used for sales trend predictions. The studies found that the best fit model is Random forest algorithm, which shows maximum accuracy in future sales prediction. The proposed framework consists of comparison of various algorithms like K-nearest neighbor, Decision tree, Random forest, XGboost, Voting regressor for better accuracy after doing a brief analysis on the same. The results summarized in performance measures are root mean square error, r-square score, and mean absolute error. The studies found that the best fit model is Xgboost regressor algorithm, with best accurate result and minimum error rate.
